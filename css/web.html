                A listening experience just for you
Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) restores the harmonics and liveliness lost during typical music compression, for a more authentic performance. You can even tailor music to your own taste with EQ settings on the Sony | Headphones Connect app, for a personalised listening experience.

                Make your music more natural
When an original music source is compressed, it loses the high-frequency elements that add detail and richness to a track. Our Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) faithfully restores these to produce high-quality sound that’s closer to the original recording.

                Multipoint connection
For total convenience, these Bluetooth® headphones can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at the same time. So when a call comes in, your headphones know which device is ringing and connects to the right one automatically.
